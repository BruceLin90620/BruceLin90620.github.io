    projects:
      - name: Boston Dynamics Spot (TSMC Industry-Academia Research Project)
        star:
          situation: "For TSMC's automated inspection needs, the robot required precise remote control in large factory environments where loading a complete map was computationally prohibitive."
          task: "My task was to enable the Spot robot to navigate to designated locations for automated inspection, overcoming large-scale map limitations."
          action:
            - "Utilized Spot's SDK and 3D-LiDAR localization based on ROS2 to enable precise remote control."
            - "Developed a map switching system and used AprilTags to provide the robot with a reliable initial position, resolving the issue of loading oversized maps."
          result: "Successfully enabled the robot to perform automated inspection tasks in a large-scale industrial environment through precise remote navigation."
