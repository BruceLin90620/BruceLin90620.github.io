# Large-Scale Inspection System: Spot

<p class="text-center">
This work presents an advanced inspection system utilizing <strong>Boston Dynamics' Spot</strong> for autonomous industrial monitoring in collaboration with <strong>TSMC</strong>. The system integrates a <strong>Routing System</strong>, <strong>Multi-Map navigation</strong>, and a <strong>digital twin simulation through NVIDIA Isaac Sim</strong> to enhance operational efficiency in large-scale environments. By combining these technologies, we establish a scalable, memory-efficient, and highly reliable framework for autonomous industrial inspection.

## System Framework

The inspection process begins with user-defined task assignments, which are processed by an intelligent routing system that determines optimal navigation paths. The routing system employs:

- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** for single-robot optimization
- **Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)** for coordinated multi-robot navigation

Once optimal routes are established, the navigation commands are relayed to the multi-map navigation system, which facilitates seamless movement across different factory sections.

## Map Switching System

Large factory environments pose challenges in handling comprehensive maps. To address this, we developed a map-switching system utilizing AprilTag markers as positional reference points. This system:

- **Optimizes memory usage** by eliminating the need to load an entire large-scale map.
- **Enhances scalability**, enabling efficient expansion of mapped areas.
- **Ensures precise localization**, with AprilTags setting Spotâ€™s initial pose after each transition.

By partitioning large spaces into manageable sub-maps and leveraging AprilTag-assisted positioning, we enable reliable and efficient navigation throughout extensive factory environments.

## 3D LiDAR Localization

Spot employs an onboard 3D LiDAR sensor to continuously scan its surroundings, generating high-resolution point cloud data. This real-time data is cross-referenced with pre-established environmental maps using the **3D Normal Distributions Transform (NDT)** algorithm for robust and precise localization.

## City Science Lab Omniverse Digital Twin

Beyond physical navigation, Spot has been integrated into a digital twin environment via **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**. This enables:

- **Virtual simulation** of navigation scenarios to optimize movement strategies before deployment.
- **Real-time visualization** of waypoints and routing paths.
- **Enhanced predictive analysis**, improving operational reliability.
